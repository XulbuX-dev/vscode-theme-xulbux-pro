## A THEME WHICH FOCUSES ON CLEAR COLORS

This VisualStudioCode extension contains two themes, which both try to make VSCode look good and do very clear syntax highlighting.

* Choose the theme (`Cmd+Schift+K` on macOS or `Ctrl+Shift+K` on Windows and Linux or `F1` on both).
* Enter "color theme" in the input field and click on `Preferences: Color Theme`.
* Search for one of the themes: "XulbuX Neon" or "XulbuX Neon Pro" and click on it to use it.

**Enjoy!**
